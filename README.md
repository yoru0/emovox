# Emovox

Emotion-conditioned Text-to-Speech — prototype notebooks for generating speech with controllable style/emotion.

## What’s inside

- `main.ipynb` — end-to-end demo: load a TTS backend, set emotion/style controls, synthesize audio, and export WAV.
- `tts.ipynb` — scratchpad for experiments (model settings, voices, prompts, etc.).

This repo is currently notebook-only and meant for quick experiments.
